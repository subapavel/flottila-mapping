# Agents, ticket classes, evidence

Every agent working here (Claude Code, its subagents, any other tool) follows `CLAUDE.md`. This
file says who does what, with which model, how many at once, and what counts as evidence. The
loop itself is `docs/WORKFLOW.md`.

## Roles

| Role | Definition | Default model · effort | Writes | Owns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| architect | the main session | Opus 5.5 · medium | issues, `agent/`, `docs/`, merges via the merger | specs, tickets, approval of red tests and designs, dispatch, decisions, findings, the spec PR |
| designer | `.claude/agents/designer.md` | Opus 5.5 · xhigh | nothing (read-only) | class-C design drafts: public types, model formats, IR shapes, ADR drafts, spec rewrites after a second FAIL |
| test-author | `.claude/agents/test-author.md` | by class | tests and fixtures in its worktree | red tests of class-C tickets, observed red |
| implementer | `.claude/agents/implementer.md` | by class | code (and tests for A/B) in its worktree | one ticket, green, scoped checks run, integration tip merged in |
| merger | `.claude/agents/merger.md` | Opus 5.5 · medium | the integration branch | merging one finished ticket branch at a time; mechanical conflicts only |
| verifier | `.claude/agents/verifier.md` | Sonnet 5.5 · low | `.logs/`, `ui/.logs/`, `ratchet/` (regeneration only) | running named checks, reporting observed results |
| scout | `.claude/agents/scout.md` | Haiku 5.5 · medium | nothing | locating code, decisions, prior evidence |
| reviewer-standards | `.claude/agents/reviewer-standards.md` | by class | nothing | the Standards axis of `/code-review` |
| reviewer-spec | `.claude/agents/reviewer-spec.md` | by class | nothing | the Spec axis of `/code-review` |
| gate-reviewer | `.claude/agents/gate-reviewer.md` | Fable 5.1 · high | nothing | milestone gates only |

The architect never edits `src/`, `ui/src/` or a test, and never runs Maven or npm itself: the
verifier does. It reads hand-backs, the red tests it approves and `git diff --stat`, not whole
patches.

## Ticket classes

Every ticket carries one `class:*` label, set when `/to-tickets` writes it. The class sets the
model and effort of every call on that ticket. Raise a class with a reason in a ticket comment;
never lower it mid-ticket.

| Class | Typical tickets | Red tests by | Implementer | Per-ticket review | Designer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `class:A` mechanical | docs, CI, fixtures, scripts, a UI component from an agreed design, a standard function with an oracle | implementer (`/tdd`) or the oracle | Sonnet 5.5 · medium | none — automatic gate only | — |
| `class:B` standard | a function family, a REST endpoint, an editor feature, an importer, a fix | implementer (`/tdd`) or the oracle | Opus 5.5 · high | none — automatic gate only | — |
| `class:C` hard path | XDM / IR / queue representation, compiler and code generator, mapping-model format, public API, concurrency, security boundary | test-author (Opus 5.5 · xhigh) | Opus 5.5 · xhigh | both axes, Opus 5.5 · xhigh, before merge | before the tests, xhigh |
| `class:G` gate | milestone gate rows | — | — | gate-reviewer (Fable 5.1 · high) | — |

Modifier labels:

- `oracle:differential` — acceptance is a set of cases where our runtime and the exported XSLT
  run in Saxon-HE must agree. No test-author; the cases are the red.
- `oracle:corpus` — acceptance is a set of golden-corpus cases (input, mapping, expected output).
- `oracle:w3c` — acceptance is a set of W3C QT3 / XSLT 3.0 test-set ids (later milestones).

An oracle ticket names its cases in the ticket body. The ratchet then keeps them green forever.

Every spec, whatever its tickets' classes, ends with one full two-axis `/code-review` of the
integration branch (`docs/WORKFLOW.md` §5).

## Concurrency

- At most **three writers** at once (implementers and test-authors), each in its own git
  worktree (`isolation: "worktree"`) on its own branch cut from the integration branch.
- At most **one merger** at a time: merges into the integration branch are serialised.
- Readers (scout, verifier, reviewers, designer) run beside the writers, at most two at once.
- `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS=4` (`.claude/settings.json`). The VM has 4 vCPU; a
  fourth Maven build in parallel makes every build slower, not the batch faster. Measured
  (ADR-0017): an engine scoped build takes 4 s alone and 9–10 s with three in parallel; a service
  build takes 14 s alone and 35 s with three.
- The verifier runs at most one build of `service` at a time; engine scoped builds may overlap.
  Worktrees share `~/.m2/repository` (file locking in `.mvn/maven.config`). No agent starts dev
  mode (`quarkus:dev`, `npm run dev`) in a gate.
- No nested delegation: subagents do not start subagents, except `/code-review` started by the
  architect, which starts its two reviewers.
- When the architect has nothing else to do while one agent runs, it waits in the foreground
  (`run_in_background: false`). Background only with two or more agents in flight.

## Hand-offs

**Design draft (designer → architect, class C)** — at most 40 lines: proposal (types, formats,
signatures), proposed test names, rejected alternatives with one line each, what is expensive to
reverse (→ ADR draft), conflicts with ADRs or the glossary, open questions.

**Acceptance spec (architect → test-author, class C)** — ticket id, worktree branch, allowed test
paths, behaviours one line each with test names, fixtures, what counts as red.

**Ticket packet (architect → implementer)** — ticket id and URL, worktree branch and its base
(integration branch tip), allowed paths, the red that defines done (test names, oracle case ids),
the ADRs and glossary terms that govern it, checks to run, constraints. Pointers, not copies:
the implementer reads the ticket, the ADRs and the code itself.

**Hand-back (any agent → architect)** — at most 40 lines: changed paths, one line per path group,
commands run with evidence word and log path, remaining uncertainty, proposed next action. A
failure quotes the failing test and at most 10 lines of its section. A turn cap returns partial
work, marked partial. No agent other than the architect comments on, labels or closes issues.

## Evidence vocabulary

Every check reported anywhere (hand-back, issue comment, PR body) carries one of:

- `VERIFIED_PASS` — ran, observed green, log path given;
- `EXECUTED_FAIL` — ran, observed red, log path and failing section given;
- `NOT_RUN` — not executed, with the reason;
- `ENVIRONMENT_BLOCKED` — could not run here, with the exact error.

A claim without observed output behind it is not evidence. A skeleton is not the feature. A
number not in `bench/RESULTS.md` does not exist.

## Memory

Implementer, test-author, merger, reviewers and designer keep
`.claude/agent-memory/<name>/MEMORY.md` (committed; durable facts only — build quirks, verified
APIs, review findings that came back twice; never ticket state; under 120 lines). When a review
FAIL repeats a lesson, the lesson goes into the reviewer's memory and the writers' self-check
lists in the same commit.
