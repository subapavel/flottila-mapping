          <p>Open a mapping from its Flottila package. Choose Edit to make changes.</p>
          <p>
            Drag a source field onto a target for a direct connection. In its expression, drag from an output to an input to connect them.
            Dropping on an occupied input replaces its wire. Move either end of a wire to reconnect it, or right-click it and choose
            Disconnect. To connect with the keyboard, focus a node, press Shift+F10 and choose Connect to.
          </p>
          <p>
            Drag the canvas to pan. Lay Out Mapping arranges the expression from left to right at its fixed scale. Copying a function also
            copies its input branches. Paste adds a separate copy, with no connection to the target. Delete Floating Objects removes all
            objects and branches that have no path to the target. A check mark means complete, an exclamation mark indicates a missing input
            or an incomplete dependency, and a dash means there is no path to the target.
          </p>
          <p>
            Double-click a function with parameters or use its gear to edit them. Right-click a node and choose Display Queue to preview its
            queue for the selected test input. Save writes the mapping file to the workspace. Test runs the mapping on the service.
