# obs-target-creation

Notation, what to return and the ESR / CPI naming: `../README.md`. Structures are in
`../../structures/observations/`. Four small mappings. Source of all of them: `src-orders.xsd`
(root `Orders`).

## Mapping create-a (target `tgt-create.xsd`, root `Create`)

`Row` is 1..2, `Val` is 0..1.

| Box | Function | Inputs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | `Constant{keep}` | none |
| A2 | `equalsS` | in1 = `Orders/Order/Line/Sku` with context `Orders`; in2 = A1 |
| A3 | `createIf` | in1 = A2 |

Target wires: A3 -> `Create/Row`; `Orders/Order/Line/Qty` (default context `Line`) -> `Create/Row/Val`.
Nothing else is mapped.

| Input | Question it decides | Tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `a1.xml` | Lines skip,keep,keep,keep: `Row` queue is `SUPPRESS,"","",""`, `maxOccurs` 2. Does SUPPRESS count toward `maxOccurs`, and do the truncated slots keep their numbers? Assumed output: two `Row`, `Val` = 2 and 3. If SUPPRESS counted: one `Row` (Val 2). If slots were renumbered: `Val` 1 and 2. | ADR-0006 bullet 3; #2 §7.2 |
| `a2.xml` | Both lines skip: `Row` queue is `SUPPRESS,SUPPRESS`, `minOccurs` 1. Does SUPPRESS count toward `minOccurs`? Assumed: yes, it does not count, so the mapping fails with a `minOccurs` shortfall. Record the error text, or the output if none. | ADR-0006 bullet 3; #2 §7.2 |
| `a3.xml` | No line at all: `Row` queue has no value. Same question as a2 for zero values; compare the two texts. | ADR-0006 bullet 3; #2 §7.2 |

## Mapping create-b (target `tgt-gen.xsd`, root `Gens`)

`Grp` is 0..unbounded, `Gen` is 2..3, `V` is 0..1.

| Box | Function | Inputs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | `Constant{a}` | none |
| B2 | `Constant{b}` | none |
| B3 | `concat` | in1 = B1, in2 = B2 |

Target wires: `Orders/Order` -> `Gens/Grp` (node to node); B3 -> `Gens/Grp/Gen`;
`Orders/Order/Line/Qty` (default context `Line`) -> `Gens/Grp/Gen/V`.

| Input | Question it decides | Tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `b1.xml` | Two orders with two lines each (Qty 1,2 and 3,4). `Gen` is generated from constants only; how many copies per `Grp` (assumed: `minOccurs` = 2, `maxOccurs` 3 ignored)? Which `Qty` lands in which `Gen`? Assumed: `Grp` 1 gets 1,2 and `Grp` 2 gets 3,4 (child number `(p - 1) * copies + j`). | ADR-0006 bullet 4; #2 §7.2 |
| `b2.xml` | Orders with 3 lines (Qty 1,2,3) and 1 line (Qty 4). Numbering is by position, not by order: assumed `Grp` 1 gets 1,2 (3 is lost) and `Grp` 2 gets 3,4. If the lines were matched per order, `Grp` 2 would get 4 only. | ADR-0006 bullet 4 |

## Mapping create-c (target `tgt-unmapped.xsd`, root `Unmapped`)

`Head` is 1..1, `A` is 0..1, `Req` is 1..1.

Target wires: `Orders/Order/Id` with context `Orders` -> `Unmapped/Head/A`. `Req` stays unmapped.

| Input | Question it decides | Tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `c1.xml` | An unmapped leaf with `minOccurs` 1: does the editor report a design-time error (record the message and where it shows: save, activation, test)? What does a run produce (an empty `Req`, no `Req`, an error)? Assumed: design-time error. | ADR-0006 bullet 5 |

## Mapping create-d (target `tgt-list.xsd`, root `Out`)

| Box | Function | Inputs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | `mapWithDefault{default=D}` | in1 = `Orders/Order/Memo/Text` (default context `Memo`) |

Target wires: `Orders/Order` -> `Out/Item` (node to node); D1 -> `Out/Item/V`.

| Input | Question it decides | Tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `d1.xml` | Orders 1 and 3 have `Memo/Text` (a, c), order 2 has no `Memo`. Does the absent parent give zero contexts (assumed: `V` queue has the contexts `a`, `c`, so `Item` 1 gets a, `Item` 2 gets c, `Item` 3 gets none) or an empty context for order 2 (then `D` appears in `Item` 2)? Also what the child queue does when it has fewer contexts than the parent has occurrences. Display queue of D1 helps. | ADR-0004 bullet 2; #2 §7.2 |
| `d2.xml` | Order 2 has `<Memo/>` with no `Text`. An empty context for a present parent: assumed `D` in `Item` 2. Compare with d1. | ADR-0004 bullet 2; #2 §7.6 |
| `d3.xml` | No order has a `Memo`. Assumed zero contexts: no `V` at all, not `D` in each `Item`. | ADR-0004 bullet 2 |
