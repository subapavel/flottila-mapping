 * The codes of the runtime errors a mapping run raises from its data (ADR-0006, ADR-0015, ADR-0025
 * since #52): error QNames, the same names the export raises. A context function has one, {@code
 * po:<catalogue name upper-cased>}, whichever of its conditions fails; a standard function's data
 * error is the W3C code the export raises too ({@code err:FORG0001}, {@code err:FOAR0001}, ADR-0025
 * "Names and fidelity"). A test run's limit, {@code flottila:TIMEOUT}, is not one of them.
