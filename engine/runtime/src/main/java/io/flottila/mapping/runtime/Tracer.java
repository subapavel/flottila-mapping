 * evaluation of a box and, since #53, one per parent slot of a target field mapping, in one list in
 * the order made, so a box evaluated twice shows twice. An untraced compile never reports. One
 * tracer serves one run.
 *
 * <p>The run's thread reports while another thread may read (ADR-0014 since #53: the facade
 * snapshots the tracer at timeout). Every report and every read holds the tracer's lock, so a read
 * is a copy of the reports made so far, in order, which later reports never reach.
