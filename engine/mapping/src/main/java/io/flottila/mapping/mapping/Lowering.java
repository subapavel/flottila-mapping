/**
 * Validation stage 3 and lowering of a mapping model to IR (ADR-0006, ADR-0011, ADR-0022; #26). A
 * target field mapping becomes {@code TargetSlots} over the queue its {@code result} gives, in its
 * parent's element: the root's, created once, or a structure field's (ADR-0006 since #52). One
 * whose {@code result} gives a single value, a generating function, becomes {@code TargetRepeat} of
 * {@code max(1, minOccurs)} copies at the target field mapping, the value in a leaf's text or, on a
 * structure field, the {@code TargetRepeat}'s value (ADR-0006 since #83). An unmapped structure
 * field whose effective occurrence is {@code n..n} with {@code n > 0} becomes {@code TargetRepeat}
 * of n copies with no value, whatever is mapped below it, an unmapped optional field is left out
 * with its subtree (ADR-0006 "Target fields"; #63), and any other unmapped field is refused. The
 * slot-number variable of a field at depth d is {@code slot<d>}, a mapped field's value variable
 * {@code value<d>}, and a field reads its parent's slot number, the root's {@code root} or the
 * parent's {@code slot<d - 1>}. A leaf's element holds its attributes and then its value, a
 * structure field's its children in target field order, attributes first; an attribute is a leaf,
 * whose {@code AttributeConstructor} holds its value (ADR-0006 since #102).
 *
 * <p>A box lowers to a queue or a single value (ADR-0006 since #83). A source-field box gives its
 * {@code SourceQueue}, of a leaf or of a structure field (ADR-0008; #63), or of an attribute, in
 * its element's context by default (ADR-0007, #102), or of a JSON property, with the depths of the
 * array properties on its path; a JSON root makes the document's input JSON, any other root XML
 * (ADR-0008 "JSON as a source at run time", #98). A standard function box whose function the
 * catalogue holds gives, by its execution kind, a {@code FunCall} over its inputs' queues, a single
 * value as {@code AtomicToQueue}, and then its params as {@code Literal}s for a context or queue
 * function. For a single-value function it gives the atomic {@code FunCall} over its inputs and
 * then the params when every input is a single value, as for {@code constant}, which has none;
 * otherwise a {@code Lift} over its queue inputs whose body is that {@code FunCall} over their slot
 * variables and the single values (ADR-0006, ADR-0025). A param the box leaves out is its catalogue
 * default, and a table param's {@code Literal} is its {@code TableText} (ADR-0026, #83). A box that
 * feeds several inputs is lowered once per use.
 *
 * <p>Stage 3 reports, each at its authoring id:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a source or target field path the structure lacks below every same-step sibling on it:
 *       {@code orphaned-reference};
 *   <li>a source or target field path through a refused field (ADR-0008 Shape (#92)), with the
 *       refusal nearest the root: its reason's code, {@code ambiguous-field-path}, or, on a target
 *       path only, {@code interleaved-target-group} (#94) or {@code abstract-target-element} (#95),
 *       which a source path passes through; at {@code /targetFieldMappings/<field path>}, once per
 *       path, an unmapped refused target field with {@code minOccurs > 0} under a parent that is
 *       created: the same;
 *   <li>a source field that is the root (#62, #63, #102), or a target field that is the root, or
 *       that stands under an unmapped parent which is neither {@code n..n} with {@code n > 0} nor
 *       optional, so that PO requires it to be mapped (#63): {@code unsupported-field}; at {@code
 *       /target}, an unmapped field that would be created beyond the recursion cap (ADR-0008):
 *       {@code unsupported-field}; at {@code /targetFieldMappings/<field path>}, an unmapped
 *       structure field with {@code 0 < minOccurs < maxOccurs} under a parent that is created, as
 *       PO requires its mapping: {@code unsupported-field};
 *   <li>a {@code result} of {@code null}: {@code unconnected-target-field};
 *   <li>at {@code /targetFieldMappings/<field path>}, a target leaf with {@code minOccurs > 0} that
 *       has no target field mapping and stands under a parent that is created, the root, a mapped
 *       field or an unmapped {@code n..n} one (ADR-0006, #65): {@code unmapped-mandatory-leaf};
 *   <li>a UDF box, or a function box whose function the catalogue does not hold yet: {@code
 *       unsupported-box-kind}; an unresolved box: {@code unresolved-function};
 *   <li>a function box against its catalogue entry: more inputs than the entry has, {@code
 *       wrong-arity}; an input slot of the entry that is {@code null} or absent, {@code
 *       unconnected-input}; a param key the entry lacks, {@code unknown-parameter}; a table for a
 *       string param or a string for a table param, {@code wrong-parameter-type}; a string outside
 *       the values of a param that lists them, or a pattern the formatting core cannot translate
 *       for a param with a syntax (ADR-0026, #74), {@code invalid-parameter-value}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Only the boxes {@code result} reaches are checked: a box it does not reach is not, and the
 * inputs of a function box refused at the box are not either. A refused target field's boxes are
 * not checked, and after a function box's first refused input its later inputs are not. One pass
 * reports all of these (#91): the target walk, which applies the unmapped rules, runs whether or
 * not every target field mapping lowers, and a mapped field whose mapping does not lower counts as
 * mapped in it.
